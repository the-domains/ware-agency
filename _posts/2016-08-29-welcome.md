# Welcome! ![Ware Agency ~ Farmers Insurance](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a9adc7ad-3e6d-4c65-8a24-55c4c2f3e84e.png)

Welcome to the website of the Ware Agency! We are proud to be a Farmers Insurance Agency and are located on Maple and Nees in Fresno, California. 

We will have videos and blog posts to help educate people on various insurance types and ideas. Our agency focuses on doing what's right for our clients 100% of the time. We will not hard sell you. We will not sell you something you don't need. We will always be honest with you. We will also do our best to educate you so you understand exactly what you have and why you have it. 

We collectively have over 60 years of customer service experience. 

Nick Ware previously worked for a local casino for about 14 years in various levels of management and senior management. He achieved his Bachelor's in Business Management in 2008 and his Masters in Business Administration in 2010\. He came to Farmers because he wanted to do more good for people while running his own business. Farmer's business model provided this opportunity as well as the backing of a large and well established company. Nick has three children of wildly varying ages and a lovely wife of 8 years. 

Trista Kaestner came on board as the first employee of the agency in 2015 a couple months after we opened the doors of our first office. She brings a solid customer service background previously working as a Food and Beverage Supervisor also from a local casino. She is the face of the agency, and the one who keeps us organized and running on a daily basis. She is your go to person if you need anything at all. 

Ket Ware is the lovely wife of the owner, Nick. She brings creativity and warmth to the agency. If you ever win a gift basket from us, more than likely she was the creator of it. She currently works in the capacity of assisting us with special events and keeping the agency bubbly and full of energy! 

We periodically post contests and whatnot onto our Facebook page, so stay tuned there. We will link back and forth between this site and the FB.
